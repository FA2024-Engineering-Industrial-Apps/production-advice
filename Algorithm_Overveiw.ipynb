    "This algorithm aims to find the optimal grouping of PCBs by iteratively forming and evaluating combinations. Starting with the first PCB, it forms an initial group and removes it from the list. The algorithm then adds subsequent PCBs to existing groups, checking if they form valid groups.The size of the first valid combination is recorded as the initial minimum number of groups. As new combinations are generated, any that exceed this minimum size are ignored. If a smaller valid combination is found, the minimum value is updated, and larger combinations are discarded. This approach ensures that the algorithm efficiently converges to the smallest possible grouping of PCBs.\n",

Initially, it follows the same approach as the hybrid algorithm, aiming to find the minimum number of groups in a valid combination through parallel processing. In the combination generation stage, the workload is distributed among processes to enhance efficiency. This is achieved by identifying valid groups of size 2 and distributing these groups among the processes. Each process then starts generating combinations, beginning with its specified group. This parallelization strategy ensures an efficient and balanced workload distribution, accelerating the overall process of finding optimal PCB groupings.\n",
