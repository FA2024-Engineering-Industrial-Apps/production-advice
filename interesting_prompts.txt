H: I want to optimize PCBs 1 2 3
S: system outputs optimal grouping
H: Now add 7 to it
-> system should ask user if 1,2,3,7 should be optimized together now 



-> Usage of SAP data when SAP orders doesnt contain the PCBs to optimize (Model should output that there are no open orders when prio base din sap is later selected)
H: Please optimize PCBs 1-8


H: Optimize 1-15
S: <tool_call>
{"name": "CallOptimizer", "arguments": {"PCBnumber": list(range(1, 16))}}
</tool_call> (Which is not correct)

H: Optimize 1-15
S: Invoking: `CallOptimizer` with `{'PCBnumber': '1-15'}`

H: optimize pcbs 1,2,3
S: *good*
H: add pcb 7
S: *good*
H: also add 5
S: *empty output*
